## Dataset

> Provide basic information about your dataset in this section. If you selected your own dataset, make sure you note the source of your data and summarize any data wrangling steps that you performed before you started your exploration.

The dataset includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering San Francisco Bay area, it includes year of birth and duration and other columns, it have nearly 180k rows 

## Summary of Findings

> Summarize all of your findings from your exploration here, whether you plan on bringing them into your explanatory presentation or not.

In the exploration, I found that there was a strong relationship between the Age of Bike rider and Duration of the ride, it was negative relationship so when the Age decreases the Duration increases and the opposite is true meaning that Younger the rider Age is the longer time the ride will be.

Other finding is between Gender the bike rider with Type of user (Customer or Subcriber), the dataset showed that male have the highest number of subscribtion and there is low male customers, the graph show there is a lot of susbrivers compare to customer.

lastley, the Duration in minutes shows that Bike riders usually ride about 5-12 minutes.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Select one or two main threads from your exploration to polish up for your presentation. Note any changes in design from your exploration step here.

For the presentation The foucs was on the main intereset (Duration, User type, Age, Gender) since they showed key insights, and leave out the rest, I started introduce each of the main of intereset of columns, after that I used the Pie chart to show Age of the bike riders, to give an idea of the Age distrbtuion, after that i showed bar chart between the Gender and User type count to show the difference between count of user typers of genders, finally
using heatmap I showed that relationship between Age and Duration, I tried to stay away of using colors untill it's really need it.
